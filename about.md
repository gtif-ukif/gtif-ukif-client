# About 


## Open for community contributions with EO mission data

Using a storytelling approach, the Dashboard combines interactive visual elements—such as maps, indicators, and dynamic charts—to explore the impacts of global events on our planet. These stories make complex data more accessible and engaging, allowing users to connect with the science in a meaningful way.

Each story draws on a curated set of indicators derived from Earth observation data, providing context and evidence for real-world phenomena. For those who want to go deeper, the Dashboard enables direct exploration of the underlying datasets, fostering transparency and discovery.

The platform is built with [open-source software](https://eodash.org) and offers simple and accessible [tools](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/story/elements-eox-storytelling--markdown-with-editor) to allow community contributions so that **anyone can create and publish their own stories**.
